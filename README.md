## Revision History

| Date       | Version | Description                          | Author |
|------------|---------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| MM/DD/YYYY | 0.1     | Initial draft (Sprint 0)             | TODO   |
| MM/DD/YYYY | 0.2     | Added use cases and architecture     | TODO   |

---

# Overview

_Start in Sprint 0; refine across all sprints._

Describe the project in 2–4 paragraphs: the problem it addresses, the target users, and a high-level summary of the proposed solution. Include a **high-level architecture diagram** 

---

# System Analysis

_Start in Sprint 0; keep updating._

## User Requirements

List the high-level functional and non-functional requirements. These will be refined into user stories and use cases. _(Main focus of Sprint 0.)_

- **FR-1:** TODO — _As a [role], I want to [capability] so that [benefit]._
- **FR-2:** TODO
- **NFR-1 (Performance):** TODO
- **NFR-2 (Usability):** TODO
- **NFR-3 (Security — see §Security):** TODO

## User Stories & Product Backlog

Link to your **GitHub Projects board** (above) and include a representative screenshot of the **Todo / In Progress / Done** columns at the end of each sprint. _(Sprint 0 onward.)_

## Use Cases

Include the **use-case diagram** and a **brief description** (1–3 sentences) for each use case. _(Main focus of Sprint 0.)_

| UC ID | Use Case            | Primary Actor | Brief Description |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| UC-01 | TODO                | TODO          | TODO              |
| UC-02 | TODO                | TODO          | TODO              |

---

# System Design

_Start in Sprint 1; keep updating._

## Architecture

Describe the architectural style (e.g., layered, client-server, microservices) and the major components. Embed an architecture diagram if it differs from the high-level one in §Overview.

## Use-Case Realization

For each use case in §Use Cases, describe how it is realized in code: which modules, endpoints, and database collections participate. **Sequence diagrams** are encouraged for non-trivial flows (e.g., authentication, message send/receive). _(Sprint 1 onward.)_

## User Interface

Embed UI mockups or screenshots and describe the interaction model. Wireframes are acceptable for Sprint 1; final screenshots for Sprint 3. _(Sprint 1 onward.)_

## Database

Describe your **MongoDB Atlas** schema: collections, fields, indexes, and relationships. Include a sample document for each collection. _(Sprint 2 onward; refine in Sprint 3.)_

```json
// Example collection: users
{
  "_id": "ObjectId",
  "username": "string (unique, indexed)",
  "passwordHash": "string (bcrypt)",
  "createdAt": "ISODate"
}
```

---

# Security (SSDLC)

_Start in Sprint 0; **mandatory** updates at the Sprint 1–2 SSDLC checkpoint and again in Sprint 3._

This section documents how your team applies the **Secure Software Development Lifecycle** across every phase. Do **not** treat security as an afterthought — it is graded across all sprints.

## Security Requirements

List security requirements alongside functional requirements. _(Sprint 0.)_
- **SR-1:** TODO — _e.g., All authentication tokens must be transmitted over HTTPS only._
- **SR-2:** TODO — _e.g., Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt (cost ≥ 12); plaintext passwords must never be logged or stored._

## Threat Model

Identify assets, trust boundaries, and threats. STRIDE or attack-tree format is acceptable. _(Sprint 0–1.)_

| Asset | Threat | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| User credentials | Credential stuffing | Rate limiting + bcrypt |
| TODO  | TODO   | TODO       |

## Security Review Notes

Summarize findings from your Sprint 2 security review and any remediation taken. _(Sprint 2 onward.)_

---

# Implementation

_Start in Sprint 1; keep updating._

Specify your development approach, languages, frameworks, and runtime. Default stack for this course:

| Layer            | Technology                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Runtime          | Node.js (Azure Cloud Shell for development)     |
| Server framework | TODO _(e.g., Express)_                          |
| Database         | MongoDB Atlas                                   |
| Client           | HTML / CSS / JavaScript _(framework optional)_  |
| Version control  | git + GitHub (branches + pull requests + code review) |
| Project mgmt     | GitHub Projects                                 |
| Hosting          | Azure App Services                              |
| CI/CD            | GitHub Actions                                  |
| ...              | ...          |

For each sprint, add a subsection that summarizes new implementation work. Include code snippets only when they illustrate a non-trivial design decision (not as a substitute for the source code itself).

## Getting Started Locally

```bash
# Clone
git clone git@github.com:TODO/TODO.git
cd TODO

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment (copy and edit; never commit .env)
cp .env.example .env

# Run
npm start
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Describe the GitHub Actions workflow(s) under `.github/workflows/`. _(Sprint 1 onward.)_

- **Build & test:** triggered on every push and pull request.
- **Deploy:** triggered on merge to `main`; deploys to Azure App Services.

## Deployment

Describe how to deploy and the URL of the live application. Include a note on environment variables (set in Azure App Services Configuration, never in source). _(Sprint 1 onward.)_

---

# Testing & Quality Assurance

_Start in Sprint 1; **major** focus in Sprint 3._

## Test Plan

Summarize your testing strategy across unit, integration, and system testing. _(Sprint 2 onward.)_

## Test Coverage

Report current test coverage and how to run the suite locally and in CI.

```bash
npm test
```

## QA Plan

Manual test cases for user-facing flows, with expected vs. actual results. _(Sprint 3.)_

---

# GenAI Usage & Reflection

_Start in Sprint 2; **required** in Sprint 3._

Per the course academic integrity policy, the team must document all AI-assisted work on the team project. **Sprint 3 recommends the team to use a GenAI tool** for the final prototype and to document each substantive prompt.

---

# Software Process Management

_Start in Sprint 0; keep updating._

Describe how your team applies **Scrum**: roles, ceremonies (sprint planning, daily stand-ups, review, retrospective), and tools (GitHub Projects board, GitHub Issues, pull requests).

Include:
- A screenshot of the **GitHub Projects board** (Todo / In Progress / Done) at the end of each sprint.
- A **Roadmap view** screenshot from GitHub Projects, or a timeline produced from issue milestones. _(Note: GitHub Projects has a Roadmap view rather than a true Gantt chart; a Roadmap screenshot satisfies this requirement.)_

## Scrum Process

> Copy the block below for each sprint (Sprint 0, 1, 2, 3).

### Sprint X

**Duration:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD

#### Sprint Goal
TODO — one sentence.

#### Completed PBIs / Tasks
1. TODO
2. TODO
3. TODO

#### Contributions

| Member | Hours | Contribution Summary |
|--------|-------|----------------------|
| Member 1 | X | TODO |
| Member 2 | X | TODO |
| Member 3 | X | TODO |
| Member 4 | X | TODO |
| Member 5 | X | TODO |

#### Sprint Retrospective

| Good | Could have been better | How to improve |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
|      |                        |                |
|      |                        |                |


Working through the sprints is a continuous-improvement process. The retrospective happens at the end of a sprint, before planning the next one. Cover three things briefly:

- **What went well** — celebrate and reinforce.
- **What could have been better** — be specific (e.g., "we underestimated authentication" not "things were hard").
- **How we will improve next sprint** — concrete, owned actions.

Keep it under an hour. The output is bullet points in the table above and any new PBIs created on the board.

# User Guide / Demo

_Start in Sprint 1; finalize in Sprint 3._

Write this section as both a **demo** (with screenshots of the running application) and a **how-to** for a first-time user. Cover sign-up, login, and the main user flows.

---
